# PHP Network Chat Application

This project is a server-based chat application that enables multiple users to communicate in real-time over the same network. It is built using **PHP** for server-side processing, **HTML** and **CSS** for the user interface, and **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions and real-time message updates.

## Features

* **Real-time messaging**: Users connected to the same network can send and receive messages instantly.
* **Multi-user support**: The system handles multiple simultaneous users, allowing group conversations.
* **Simple and intuitive interface**: Clean UI built with HTML and CSS for ease of use.
* **Lightweight and fast**: Minimal resource usage ensures smooth performance even on small local networks.
* **Local network deployment**: Designed to work within LAN environments, making it ideal for classrooms, small offices, or personal projects.
* **Basic message management**: Messages are processed and stored temporarily on the server, allowing seamless conversation flow.

## Technologies Used

* **PHP**: Handles server-side message processing and communication between users.
* **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling of the chat interface.
* **JavaScript**: Enables real-time message updates without page reloads.

## How It Works

1. Users connect to the chat application through a browser on the same network.
2. The PHP server manages incoming messages and broadcasts them to all connected users.
3. JavaScript dynamically updates the chat window in real-time as messages are sent and received.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the basics of **real-time web communication**, server-client interaction, and multi-user functionality. It is ideal for learning purposes, small-scale team communication, or as a starting point for more complex chat applications.
